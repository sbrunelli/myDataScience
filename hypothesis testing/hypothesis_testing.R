## Hypothesis Testing
##
## As MLB Analysts we're interested in testing the hypothesis
## that teams who make it to the postseason spend more money
## on salaries for their rosters

##  HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION
##
##  Null Hypothesis: mu_ps - mu_rs = 0
##  Alternative Hypothesis: mu_ps - mu_rs > 0
##
##  Confidence Level: 0.05
##
###################################################

## Before we do anything we need to check whether 
## the conditions for applying the methods are met
##
##  Are the two samples normaly distributed
hist(postseason_teams$salary)
hist(regular_season_teams$salary)
hist(postseason_teams$adj_salary)
hist(regular_season_teams$adj_salary)
## We might need to adjust for the price index

alpha <- 0.05

## First we need to calculate the 2 means
mu_ps <- mean(postseason_teams$adj_salary)
mu_rs <- mean(regular_season_teams$adj_salary)

## Test Characteristics
##
##  We're comparing 2 groups on a quantitative variable
##  therefore we'll perform a T-test
##
##  We'll consider the 2 groups as independent
##
##  1st of all calculate the difference between the 2 means
difference <- mu_ps - mu_rs

##  Than calculate the standard deviation of the difference
##  between the 2 means, using the formula
##
##  se = (mu_ps - mu_rs) / sqrt ((mu_ps^2/n_ps) + (mu_rs^2/n_rs)) 
n_ps <- nrow(postseason_teams)
n_rs <- nrow(regular_season_teams)
sd_ps <- sd(postseason_teams$adj_salary)
sd_rs <- sd(regular_season_teams$adj_salary)
se <- sqrt(((sd_ps^2)/n_ps) +((sd_rs^2)/n_rs))
t <- round(difference / se, digits = 2)

##  Given the Test Statistics, we can now
##   - calculate the p-value and compare it to alpha
##   - calculate the rejection region and see if
##      t falls within it or not
var_ps <- sd_ps^2
var_rs <- sd_rs^2
df <- ((var_ps/n_ps) + (var_rs/n_rs)) / ((1/(n_ps-1))*(var_ps/n_ps)+(1/(n_rs-1))*(var_rs/n_rs))
p_value <- pt(q = t, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE)
if (p_value < alpha) { print("p-value: Reject HO") } else { print("p-value: Do not reject H0") }

cutoff <- qt(p = (1-alpha), df = df)
if(t > cutoff) { print("rejection region: Reject HO") } else { print("rejection region: Do not reject H0") }

## As another alternative we can calculate the confidence interval for the
## mean difference
## CI = difference +/- t(alpha/2) * se
t_demi_alpha <- qt(p = (1 - alpha/2), df = df)
lower_bound <- difference - t_demi_alpha * se
upper_bound <- difference + t_demi_alpha * se
confint <- round(c(lower_bound, upper_bound), digits = 3)
if ( (lower_bound <= 0) & (0 <= upper_bound) ) { print("Confidence interval: Do not reject HO") } else { print("Confidence interval: Reject H0") } 


## Is there a correlation between salary and PCT?
all_teams <- dt_union(postseason_teams, regular_season_teams)
plot(all_teams$PCT~all_teams$adj_salary)
cor(x = all_teams$salary, y = all_teams$PCT, method="pearson")
## The plot and the Pearson's correlation coefficient
## suggest a very low correlation between the 2 variables
