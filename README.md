# myDataScience

This repo contains (will contain ...) my experiments, exercises and studies in the field of Data Science, as I progress through a thorough educational path.
I don't have the claim to be the ultimate data scientist, I know a lot of you out there have a bigger experience than me, so any feedback will be absolutely
of invaluable importance for me along the way.

## Site Structure
The site will be divided in two different sections:

1. examples: it's intentionally going to be a section where the focus is on the application of the various techniques, not on the business relevance of the problems I'll try to solve.
	
2. business: here I will try to address more meaningfull business problems and the techniques that I apply will be just a tool to the reach a certain goal, but the focus will be on the actual scientific approach as to how to solve a problem, not on the tools used to do it.
	
## The Tools
I will try to diversify from time to time which tool I use. That is because I think each tool should be secondary to the problem we're faced with.
That said the main tools will be:

* **R**: main statistical software
* **Python**: as an alternative to R
* **Excel**: just to prove that fancy statistical software may not be always absolutely necessary
* **Tableau**: when it comes to data visualizations I'll post links to Tableau Public
	
#Section 1: Examples
Here's the list of currently available examples:

* [Hypothesis Testing](./hypothesis testing) (publish on 5/13/2016): an example of the application of hypothesis testing to establish if the difference in two groups is statistically significant. Business Question : "Using the data from the Major League Basebell are the teams making the postseason spending more money for players salaries than those who don't?"
